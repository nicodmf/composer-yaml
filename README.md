# composer-yaml

This project allows you to convert a composer.yml file into composer.json
format. It will use those exact filenames of your current working directory.

Warning: If you already have a composer.json file, it will overwrite it.

## Installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/igorw/composer-yaml && cd composer-yaml
    $ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    $ php composer.phar install

## Build Phar package

    $ curl -s http://box-project.org/installer.php | php
    $ php box.phar build
    $ chmod +x composer-yaml.phar
